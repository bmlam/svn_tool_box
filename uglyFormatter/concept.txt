the UglyFormatter is supposed to format PLSQL solely for the purpose of providing consistent output given tbe same input

this formatter can implemented in Python or PLSQL

*use a stack to store the token nodes
*we distiguish tree node and leaf nodes. 
*The following are tree nodes:
	**package spec
	**package body
	**anonyumous block
	**assignment
	**method call 
*The following are leaf nodes:
	** comments
	** identifier
	** arimetric operators
	** assignment operator
	** comparision operator
	** unary operator
*Each token node has these properties:
	**unique id from sequence
	**text
	**token type
	**is tree of leaf (derived from token type)
	**self text length
	**tree text length if self is a tree node.  The tree root node has the total length of all child nodes.
	**parent node is if applicable
*the stack is populated until the end of a compilation unit.
*the stack is discharged LIFO.
*A node class is defined to be used as elements of the stack.
